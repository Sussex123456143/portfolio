For the entirety of my formative years, I have wanted to be a computer scientist. This is my goal in life because the work of computer scientists, is valuable, rewarding work. Developing new technologies that improve life speaks to me. To achieve my lofty aspirations, I know that there are some things that I must do to become the best scientist I could be. One of these things was the acquisition of real- life experiences creating programs. Another was acceptance into a school for engineering, like Kettering University. However, once all of these were completed, the most important step of all arrives: the acquisition of job experience. Kettering University cuts out school so students can go get jobs, which is conveniently compatible with my plans, and is also the reason that I am heavily considering it.
<br>
<br>
I believe that I am a good fit for the job because I have a willingness to learn, as displayed when I was on vacation in San Diego, where I had to learn math concepts by reading the homework, with no internet to aid my cause. As I had no access to the internet, all I could rely on were the diagrams on the worksheet and the instructions. However, since I have a good learning mindset, I was able to keep my hopes high and examine the diagrams for contextual clues, and when I came back to class, I was on the same level as everybody else. This skill of mine can be applied in the workforce- no matter how the company evolves, I will be able to handle the challenge in an exceptional manner.
<br>
<br>
Another beneficial trait I have is my love for group work. I work at my best when being able to collaborate with my peers, as evidenced when I chaired a speech event. In this event, I had to work in tandem with a co-chair to create the schedule, invite the judges, and collect information from all of the competitors. Altogether- the event turned out to be a success. And with those same teamwork skills, I can be a success in the workplace as well.
<br>
<br>
I have teamwork and a willingness to work. These are skills that improve a workplace's productivity. In my future, I want to make life better for everybody with advanced technology because there is nothing more pure and impressive than innovation. Thank you for taking the time to read this essay.
